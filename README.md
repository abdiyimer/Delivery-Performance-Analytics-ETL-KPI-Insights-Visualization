## Delivery Performance Analytics — ETL, KPI Insights & Visualization
### 📌 Overview

This project analyzes delivery and order performance data to evaluate service reliability, platform adoption, and operational efficiency.
It includes data ingestion, cleaning, integration, EDA, KPI insights, and Power BI dashboards, providing actionable recommendations for improving SLA compliance, reducing delays, and addressing operational gaps.

### 📂 Dataset

Multiple raw datasets collected from different sources (CSV format), including:

Orders data

Delivery performance data

Carrier details

Complaints / incidents

All datasets were cleaned, validated, joined, and transformed into one consolidated analytical dataset.
